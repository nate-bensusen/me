# me

Self checklists, cycles, habits, exercise, and nutrition I want to keep up on. Also makes things easily sharable and open to contributions.

my goal is to stay in contact and keep in touch sincerely.
my goal is to do 6+ hours a week of 100+ bpm stuff
my goal is to do at least one a week of each: Legs, Push, Pull
My goal is to ride or jump rope

live life like I'm a video game character. What stats do I want to min max and how am I going to do that?
