# lifelog

in here i will upload my progress monthly

ie(or eg?)

## structure

- 2024/
  - Dec.md
- 2025/
  - Jan.md

each month should have each day as a subheading and some kind of the following set of list completed and filled out

- lifelog { ### date
  - daily checklist
  - exercise log
  - food log
  - what happened today? or short journal of events. (and a shorter title for this bullet point)

  }

## example

an example of an excellent day would be something like this

- 2024/
  - [Feb.md](feb-ex.md)
