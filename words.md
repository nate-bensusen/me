- Don't ever give up
- Everything worth doing is hard
- The only time that matters is right now
- It's okay to feel lost
- Live life to the full because you never know what's around the corner
- So let's take a part of the world and make it our own
- Don't let the bastards grind you down
- You saved me
- Keep running on
- There's no fate but what we make for ourselves
- We always have each other
- Keep your head up, kid
- Always fear regret more than failure
- Stay true to yourself
- There is still good in the world
- Expect nothing and appreciate everything
- It was all worth it
- The sun never sets on your dreams
